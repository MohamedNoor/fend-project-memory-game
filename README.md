How to Play:

There are 16 cards on a board and 8 matching pairs. Click on the cards to reveal icons and see if you got a match!

This memory game is won by matching the respective symbols to each other. The amount of moves and time you have is infinite.

If the cards match, they will remain open. If they do not match, they will flip over and you can try again.

Once you get all 8 matches, the game is over and you will receive a star rating based on how well you did.
